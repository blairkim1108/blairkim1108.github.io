# **Facebook’s Emotion Manipulation Experiment - Implications in Data Ethics**

## Introduction

-   In 2014, Facebook (now Meta) ran a large‑scale psychological experiment on 689,003 users, altering their News Feed to test whether emotions on social media are contagious (Kramer, Guillory & Hancock, 2014).

-   Emotional contagion had previously been studied in person—e.g., the Framingham Heart Study tracked 4,739 individuals over 20 years and found that happiness spreads through social networks (Fowler & Christakis, 2008).

-   While pioneering in the digital realm, Facebook’s study raises serious ethical questions about how users were informed and protected.

## Data Ethics Principles

from [Data Values and Principles manifesto](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/)

As data teams, we aim to...

1.  Use data to improve life for our users, customers, organizations, and communities.
2.  Create reproducible and extensible work.
3.  Recognize and mitigate bias in ourselves and in the data we use.
4.  Consider carefully the ethical implications of choices we make when using data, and the impacts of our work on individuals and society.
5.  Protect the privacy and security of individuals represented in our data.

## About the Study

-   **Method:** Randomly assigned users to one of three groups—positive‑emotion, negative‑emotion, or control—and manipulated the emotional content in their News Feed.

-   **Measure:** Collected and analyzed subsequent status updates to quantify changes in users’ emotional expression.

-   **Results:** Users exposed to fewer positive posts wrote more negative updates (and vice versa), demonstrating online emotional contagion.

## Data Ethics Concern: Consent Structure

-   Claimed “consent” via Facebook’s Data Use Policy, rather than through informed‐consent procedures standard in psychological research.

-   No participant briefing on study aims, potential harms, right to withdraw, or debriefing and support for emotional distress.

-   Conducted before “research” was explicitly added to the policy; likely included minors without age screening.

## Data Ethics Concern: Anonymity of data

-   Participants identified only by user ID, but these IDs link to personal profiles and Messenger chats.

-   Facebook researchers’ internal access could re‑identify individuals, compromising true anonymity.

## Data Ethics Concern: Representativeness of the Sample

-   Sampling by user ID was strictly random, yet no demographic data (age, gender, race) were collected or reported.

-   Unknown whether certain groups were over‑ or under‑represented, limiting the study’s generalizability.

-   Questionable whether results can be generalized to people who are not on Facebook

## Data Ethics Concern: Accessibility of the Data

-   Raw data were not made publicly available, protecting user privacy but preventing reproducibility.

-   Lack of open access hinders independent verification of analyses and further research building on these findings.

## Conclusion

-   Emotional contagion in digital space might be real.

-   Although the findings of the study were pioneering, ethics of this study is problematic.

-   Better data collection practice is important for the integrity of the research and reliability of its findings.
